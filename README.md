# UDP_Joystick_Emulation
 A joystick emulator that turned an UDP stream coming from a MEMS into a joystick input for the flight simulator 

 An old project from 2013 that turned an UDP stream coming from a MEMS into a joystick input for the MS Flight Simulator. 
 The position of the MEMS controller determined the plane attitude of the simulator providing a more intuitive flight control.

 Not maintained nor used since 2013. Dumped here for later and mainly to remember the idea, well, much later... Tempus fugit.

# Dependencies
